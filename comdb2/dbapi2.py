"""This module provides a DB-API 2.0 compatible Comdb2 API.

Overview
========

This module provides a Comdb2 interface that conforms to `the Python Database
API Specification v2.0 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/>`_.

Basic Usage
-----------

The main class used for interacting with a Comdb2 is `Connection`, which you
create by calling the `connect` factory function.  Any errors that are
encountered when connecting to or querying the database are raised as instances
of the `Error` class.

A basic usage example looks like this::

    from comdb2 import dbapi2
    conn = dbapi2.connect('mattdb', autocommit=True)
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("select 1, 'a' union all select 2, 'b'")
    for row in cursor.fetchall():
        print(row)

The above would result in the following output::

    [1, 'a']
    [2, 'b']

To reduce the amount of boilerplate required for fetching result sets, we
implement 2 extensions to the interface required by the Python DB-API: `Cursor`
objects are iterable, yielding one row of the result set per iteration, and
`Cursor.execute` returns the `Cursor` itself.  By utilizing these extensions,
the basic example can be shortened to::

    from comdb2 import dbapi2
    conn = dbapi2.connect('mattdb', autocommit=True)
    for row in conn.cursor().execute("select 1, 'a' union all select 2, 'b'"):
        print(row)

Graceful Teardown and Error Handling
------------------------------------

Non-trivial applications should guarantee that the `Connection` is closed when
it is no longer needed, preferably by using `contextlib.closing`.  They should
also be prepared to handle any errors returned by the database.  So, a more
thorough version of the example above would be::

    from comdb2 import dbapi2
    from contextlib import closing
    try:
        with closing(dbapi2.connect('mattdb', autocommit=True)) as conn:
            query = "select 1, 'a' union all select 2, 'b'"
            for row in conn.cursor().execute(query):
                print(row)
    except dbapi2.Error as exc:
        print("Comdb2 exception encountered: %s" % exc)

In this example, `contextlib.closing` is used to guarantee that
`Connection.close` is called at the end of the ``with`` block, and an exception
handler been added for exceptions of type `Error`.  All exceptions raised by
this module are subclasses of `Error`.  See :ref:`Exceptions` for details on
when each exception type is raised.

Controlling the Type Used For Result Rows
-----------------------------------------

As you can see, rows are returned as a `list` of column values in positional
order.  If you'd prefer to get the columns back as some other type, you can set
`Connection.row_factory` to one of the factories provided by
`comdb2.factories` - for example::

    from comdb2 import dbapi2
    from comdb2 import factories
    conn = dbapi2.connect('mattdb', autocommit=True)
    conn.row_factory = factories.dict_row_factory
    c = conn.cursor()
    for row in c.execute("select 1 as 'x', 2 as 'y' union all select 3, 4"):
        print(row)

This program will return each row as a `dict` rather than a `list`::

    {'y': 2, 'x': 1}
    {'y': 4, 'x': 3}

Parameter Binding
-----------------

In real applications you'll often need to pass parameters into a SQL query.
This is done using parameter binding - in the query, placeholders are specified
using ``%(name)s``, and a mapping of ``name`` to parameter value is passed to
`Cursor.execute` along with the query.  The ``%(`` and ``)s`` are fixed, and
the ``name`` between them varies for each parameter.  For example:

    >>> query = "select 25 between %(a)s and %(b)s"
    >>> print(conn.cursor().execute(query, {'a': 20, 'b': 42}).fetchall())
    [[1]]
    >>> params = {'a': 20, 'b': 23}
    >>> print(conn.cursor().execute(query, params).fetchall())
    [[0]]

In this example, we run the query with two different sets of
parameters, producing different results.  First, we execute the query with
parameter ``a`` bound to ``20`` and ``b`` bound to ``42``.  In this case,
because ``20 <= 25 <= 42``, the expression evaluates to true, and a ``1`` is
returned.

When we run the same query with parameter ``b`` bound to ``23``, a ``0`` is
returned instead, because ``20 <= 25 <= 23`` is false.

Note:
    Because parameters are bound using ``%(name)s``, other ``%`` signs in
    a query must be escaped.  For example, ``WHERE name like 'M%'`` becomes
    ``WHERE name LIKE 'M%%'``.

Types
-----

For all Comdb2 types, the same Python type is used for binding a parameter
value as is returned for a SQL query result column of that type.  In brief, SQL
types are mapped to Python types according to the following table:

============   ================================================================
SQL type       Python type
============   ================================================================
NULL           ``None``
integer        `int`
real           `float`
blob           `bytes`
text           `str`
datetime       `datetime.datetime`
datetimeus     `DatetimeUs`
============   ================================================================

See :ref:`Comdb2 to Python Type Mappings` for a thorough explanation of these
type mappings and their implications.

Note:
    This module uses byte strings to represent BLOB columns, and Unicode
    strings to represent TEXT columns.  This is a very common source of
    problems for new users.
    Make sure to carefully read :ref:`String and Blob Types` on that page.

.. _Autocommit Mode:

Autocommit Mode
---------------

In all of the examples above, we gave the ``autocommit=True`` keyword argument
when calling `connect`.  This opts out of DB-API compliant transaction
handling, in order to use Comdb2's native transaction semantics.

By default, DB-API cursors are always in a transaction.  You can commit that
transaction using `Connection.commit`, or roll it back using
`Connection.rollback`.  For example::

    conn = dbapi2.connect('mattdb')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    query = "insert into simple(key, val) values (%(key)s, %(val)s)"
    cursor.execute(query, {'key': 1, 'val': 2})
    cursor.execute(query, {'key': 3, 'val': 4})
    cursor.execute(query, {'key': 5, 'val': 6})
    conn.commit()

There are several things to note here.  The first is that the insert statements
that were sent to the database don't take effect immediately, because they are
implicitly part of a transaction that must be explicitly completed.  This is
different from other Comdb2 APIs, where you must execute a ``BEGIN`` statement
to start a transaction, and where statements otherwise take effect immediately.

The second thing to note is that there are certain error conditions where
a Comdb2 connection can automatically recover when outside of a transaction,
but not within a transaction.  In other words, using transactions when they
aren't needed can introduce new failure modes into your program.

In order to provide greater compatibility with other Comdb2 interfaces and
to eliminate the performance costs and extra error cases introduced by using
transactions unnecessarily, we allow you to pass the non-standard
``autocommit=True`` keyword argument when creating a new `Connection`. This
results in the implicit transaction not being created. You can still start
a transaction explicitly by passing a ``BEGIN`` statement to
`Cursor.execute`.  For example::

    conn = dbapi2.connect('mattdb', autocommit=True)
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("delete from simple where 1=1")
    cursor.execute("begin")
    query = "insert into simple(key, val) values (%(key)s, %(val)s)"
    cursor.execute(query, {'key': 1, 'val': 2})
    cursor.execute(query, {'key': 3, 'val': 4})
    cursor.execute(query, {'key': 5, 'val': 6})
    cursor.execute("rollback")

In this example, because we've used ``autocommit=True`` the delete statement
takes effect immediately (that is, it is automatically committed).  We then
explicitly create a transaction, insert 3 rows, then decide not to commit
it, and instead explicitly roll back the transaction.

To summarize: you cannot use ``autocommit`` mode if you intend to pass the
`Connection` to a library that requires DB-API compliant connections.  You
should prefer ``autocommit`` mode when you don't want to use transactions (for
example, read-only queries where no particular consistency guarantees are
required across queries).  If you do intend to use transactions but won't pass
the `Connection` to a library that requires DB-API compliance, you can choose
either mode.  It may be easier to port existing code if you use ``autocommit``
mode, but avoiding ``autocommit`` mode may allow you to use 3rd party libraries
in the future that require DB-API compliant connections.

DB-API Compliance
-----------------

The interface this module provides fully conforms to `the Python Database API
Specification v2.0 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/>`_ with a few
specific exceptions:

1. DB-API requires ``Date`` and ``DateFromTicks`` constructors, which we don't
   provide because Comdb2 has no type for representing a date without a time
   component.

2. DB-API requires ``Time`` and ``TimeFromTicks`` constructors, which we don't
   provide because Comdb2 has no type for representing a time without a date
   component.

3. DB-API is unclear about the required behavior of multiple calls to
   `Connection.cursor` on a connection.  Comdb2 does not have a concept of
   cursors as distinct from connection handles, so each time
   `Connection.cursor` is called, we call `Cursor.close` on any existing, open
   cursor for that connection.

    you want.  If you need to connect to a database that's running on your
    local machine rather than a cluster, you can pass "local" as the ``tier``.
    It's also permitted to specify "dev", "alpha", "beta", or "prod" as the
    ``tier``, which will connect you directly to the tier you specify (firewall
    permitting).

    Alternately, you can pass a machine name as the ``host`` argument, to
    connect directly to an instance of the given database on that host, rather
    than on a cluster or the local machine.

    The connection will use UTC as its timezone by default - you can change
    this with a ``SET TIMEZONE`` statement if needed.

    By default, or if ``autocommit`` is ``False``, `cursor` will return cursors
    that behave as mandated by the Python DB API: every statement to be
    executed is implicitly considered to be part of a transaction, and that
    transaction must be ended explicitly with a call to `commit` (or
    `rollback`).  If ``autocommit`` is ``True``, `cursor` will instead return
    cursors that behave more in line with Comdb2's traditional behavior: the
    side effects of any given statement are immediately committed unless you
    previously started a transaction by executing a ``begin`` statement.

    Note:
        Using ``autocommit=True`` will ease porting from code using other
        Comdb2 APIs, both because other Comdb2 APIs implicitly commit after
        each statement in the same way as an autocommit `Connection` will, and
        because there are certain operations that Comdb2 will implicitly
        retry when outside of a transaction but won't retry when inside
        a transaction - meaning that a non-autocommit `Connection` has extra
        failure modes.  You should strongly consider using ``autocommit=True``,
        especially for read-only use cases.

    Note:
        Python does not guarantee that object finalizers will be called when
        the interpreter exits, so to ensure that the connection is cleanly
        released you should call the `close` method when you're done with it.
        You can use `contextlib.closing` to guarantee the connection is
        released when a block completes.

        By default each row is returned as a `list`, where the elements in the
        list correspond to the result row's columns in positional order, but
        this can be changed with the `Connection.row_factory` property.

        Note:
            This is not required by DB-API 2.0; for maximum portability
            applications should prefer to use `fetchone` or `fetchmany` or
            `fetchall` instead.

            >>> cursor.execute("select 1, 2 UNION ALL select 3, 4")
