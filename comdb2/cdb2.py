"""This module provides a thin, pythonic wrapper over cdb2api.

Overview
========

Basic Usage
-----------

The main class used for interacting with a Comdb2 is `Handle`.  A basic usage
example looks like this::

    from comdb2 import cdb2
    hndl = cdb2.Handle('mattdb')
    for row in hndl.execute("select 1, 'a' union all select 2, 'b'"):
        print(row)

Which would result in the following output::

    [1, 'a']
    [2, 'b']

Graceful Teardown and Error Handling
------------------------------------

Non-trivial applications should guarantee that the handle is closed when it is
no longer needed, preferably by using `contextlib.closing`.  They should also
be prepared to handle any errors returned by the database.  Failures that are
encountered when connecting to or querying the database are raised as instances
of the `Error` class.  So, a more thorough version of the example above would
be::

    from comdb2 import cdb2
    import contextlib
    try:
        with contextlib.closing(cdb2.Handle('mattdb')) as hndl:
            for row in hndl.execute("select 1, 'a' union all select 2, 'b'"):
                print(row)
    except cdb2.Error as exc:
        print("Comdb2 exception encountered: %s" % exc)

In this example, `contextlib.closing` is used to guarantee that `Handle.close`
is called at the end of the ``with`` block, and an exception
handler been added for exceptions of type `Error`.

Controlling the Type Used For Result Rows
-----------------------------------------

As you can see, rows are returned as a `list` of column values in positional
order.  If you'd prefer to get the columns back as some other type, you can set
`Handle.row_factory` to one of the factories provided by
`comdb2.factories` - for example::

    from comdb2 import cdb2
    from comdb2 import factories
    hndl = cdb2.Handle('mattdb')
    hndl.row_factory = factories.dict_row_factory
    for row in hndl.execute("select 1 as 'x', 2 as 'y' union all select 3, 4"):
        print(row)

This program will return each row as a `dict` rather than a `list`::

    {'y': 2, 'x': 1}
    {'y': 4, 'x': 3}

Parameter Binding
-----------------

In real applications you'll often need to pass parameters into a SQL query.
This is done using parameter binding - in the query, placeholders are specified
using ``@name``, and a mapping of names to values is passed to `Handle.execute`
along with the query.  For example:

    >>> query = "select 25 between @a and @b"
    >>> print(list(hndl.execute(query, {'a': 20, 'b': 42})))
    [[1]]
    >>> params = {'a': 20, 'b': 23}
    >>> print(list(hndl.execute(query, params)))
    [[0]]

In this example, we run the query with two different sets of
parameters, producing different results.  First, we execute
the query with ``@a`` bound to ``20`` and ``@b`` bound to ``42``.  In this
case, because ``20 <= 25 <= 42``, the expression evaluates to true, and a ``1``
is returned.

When we run the same query with ``@b`` bound to ``23``, a ``0``
is returned instead, because ``20 <= 25 <= 23`` is false.  In both of these
examples we make use of the `list` constructor to turn the iterable returned
by `Handle.execute` into a list of result rows.

Types
-----

For all Comdb2 types, the same Python type is used for binding a parameter
value as is returned for a SQL query result column of that type.  In brief, SQL
types are mapped to Python types according to the following table:

============   ================================================================
SQL type       Python type
============   ================================================================
NULL           ``None``
integer        `int`
real           `float`
blob           `six.binary_type` (aka `bytes` in Python 3, ``str`` in Python 2)
text           `six.text_type` (aka `str` in Python 3, ``unicode`` in Python 2)
datetime       `datetime.datetime`
datetimeus     `DatetimeUs`
============   ================================================================

See :ref:`Comdb2 to Python Type Mappings` for a thorough explanation of these
type mappings and their implications.

Note:
    This module uses byte strings to represent BLOB columns, and Unicode
    strings to represent TEXT columns.  This is a very common source of
    problems for new users.
    Make sure to carefully read :ref:`String and Blob Types` on that page.

    you want.  If you need to connect to a database that's running on your
    local machine rather than a cluster, you can pass "local" as the ``tier``.
    It's also permitted to specify "dev", "alpha", "beta", or "prod" as the
    ``tier``, which will connect you directly to the tier you specify (firewall
    permitting).

    Alternately, you can pass a machine name as the ``host`` argument, to
    connect directly to an instance of the given database on that host, rather
    than on a cluster or the local machine.

    By default, the connection will use UTC as its timezone.  This differs from
    cdb2api's default behavior, where the timezone used by the query differs
    depending on the machine that it is run from.  If for some reason you need
    to have that machine-specific default timezone instead, you can pass
    ``None`` for the ``tz`` argument.  Any other valid timezone name may also
    be used instead of 'UTC'.

    Note that Python does not guarantee that object finalizers will be called
    when the interpreter exits, so to ensure that the handle is cleanly
    released you should call the `close` method when you're done with it.  You
    can use `contextlib.closing` to guarantee the handle is released when
