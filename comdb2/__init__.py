"""This package provides Python interfaces to Comdb2 databases.

Two different Python submodules are provided for interacting with Comdb2
databases.

`comdb2.dbapi2` provides an interface that conforms to `the Python Database API
Specification v2.0 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/>`_.  If you're
already familiar with the Python DB-API, or if you intend to use libraries that
expect to be given DB-API compliant connections, this module is likely to be
the best fit for you.  Additionally, if a better way of communicating with
a Comdb2 database than ``libcdb2api`` is ever introduced, this module will be
upgraded to it under the hood.

`comdb2.cdb2` provides a thin, pythonic wrapper over cdb2api.  If you're more
familiar with ``libcdb2api`` than with the Python DB-API and you don't
anticipate a need to interact with libraries that require DB-API compliant
connections, this module may be simpler to get started with.
