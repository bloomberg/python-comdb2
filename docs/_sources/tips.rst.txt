Best Practices, Tips, and Tricks

#. This package uses `six.text_type` for text and `bytes` for blobs; this may
   be surprising if you're using `str` in Python 2.  See :doc:`types` for an
   explanation of what Python types must be used when binding parameters, and
   what Python types will be returned for result columns.

   An error message saying "incompatible values from SQL blob of length 3 to
   bcstring field 'foo'" most likely means that you passed a byte string where
   a unicode string should have been passed.

   An error message saying "incompatible values from SQL string of length 3 to
   bbytearray field 'bar'" most likely means that you passed a unicode string
   where a byte string should have been passed.

   Not all places where you pass the wrong type of string will result in an
   exception - in some cases the SQL query will appear to succeed but
   a ``WHERE`` clause that you expected to match some rows will silently fail
   to match any.

#. Prefer using Python 3 rather than Python 2 when possible.  The above type
   mappings are much more intuitive in Python 3 than in Python 2.  If you can't
   use Python 3 but are writing a new module, prefer to use ``from __future__
   import unicode_literals`` to opt into forward compatible unicode string
   literals (rather than the default, string literals as byte strings).

#. The database can time out connections that have been idle for a period of
   time, and each idle connection uses some amount of resources on the database
   server, so avoid leaving sessions open when they're not in use.  As an
   example, prefer opening a new database connection for each client request in
   a service.

#. Running a SQL statement using the `.dbapi2` interface will implicitly open
   a transaction, as per PEP-249.  This means that, unlike other Comdb2
   interfaces, you need to explicitly call `.Connection.commit` to save your
   changes.  If you write a program that seems to succeed but doesn't make the
   updates you expected, make sure you didn't miss a call to
   `~.Connection.commit`.

#. When transactions aren't needed, prefer using :ref:`Autocommit Mode` on your
   `.dbapi2.Connection` objects.  It results in less bookkeeping on the
   database server, and results in transparent retries after some error
   conditions - and it makes the behavior more consistent with other Comdb2
   interfaces.

#. Always prefer binding parameters over dynamically generating SQL queries.
   Instead of this::

       c.execute("SELECT * FROM test where id=%s" % my_id)

   Always do this::

       c.execute("SELECT * FROM test where id=%(id)s", {'id': my_id})

   Because of this: https://xkcd.com/327/

   .. note::
       The two modules provided by this package use different syntax for SQL
       placeholders.  See `.dbapi2.Cursor.execute` and `.cdb2.Handle.execute`
       for details.

#. For `.dbapi2`, be sure to escape any ``%`` signs in a query by doubling
   them.  That is, instead of::

       c.execute("select * from tbl where col like 'foo%'")

   You need to write::

       c.execute("select * from tbl where col like 'foo%%'")

   See `.dbapi2.paramstyle` for an explanation of why.

#. Unlike many other databases, Comdb2 does not allow you to read uncommitted
   rows by default, even from the cursor that created them.  If you need to be
   able to read your own uncommitted work, you must execute ``set transaction
   read committed`` as the first statement on a new `.dbapi2.Connection` or
   `.cdb2.Handle` (any isolation level higher than ``READ COMMITTED`` would
   obviously work as well).
